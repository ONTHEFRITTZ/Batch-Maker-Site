      <p>
        By using Batch Maker, you agree to the following terms. Please read them
        carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of the service</h2>
      <p>
        Batch Maker is provided to help organize recipes, batches, and production
        workflows. You agree to use the service responsibly and only for lawful
        purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for
        any activity that occurs under it. You must provide accurate information
        when creating an account.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscriptions & billing</h2>
      <p>
        Batch Maker offers a 30-day free trial. After the trial, a paid
        subscription is required to continue using premium features. Prices,
        billing cycles, and renewal terms are clearly presented at the time of
        purchase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours
        before the end of the current billing period.
      </p>

      <h2>Account deletion</h2>
      <p>
        You may delete your account and all associated data at any time from
        within your account settings or by contacting support. Account deletion
        is permanent and cannot be undone.
      </p>

      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to keep Batch Maker available and reliable, but the service is
        provided “as is” without guarantees of uninterrupted access.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
      <p>
        These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the
        service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated
        terms.
      </p>
